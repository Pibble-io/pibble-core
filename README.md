# Pibble-core

- 'PIBBLE Project' aims to build a 'Blockchain based, Monetized Image Ecosystem' to enable image creators to take proper rights to their creations.
- This will serve as a platform for anyone to become an image seller and consumer, to protect the rights of the creator and to establish the copyright protection of the creator of the creation.
- PIBBLE Ecosystem will be recognized as a 'system that can guarantee fair value' among the creators, and it will be expanded to a form in which the value increases as the number of users increases.
